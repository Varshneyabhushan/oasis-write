# Oasis-write

## Our Mission

To provide a serene and focused writing environment for markdown enthusiasts, blending seamless, real-time rendering with minimalist design and essential file management. Oasis-write is your personal sanctuary for thought and expression, free from clutter and distractions.

## The "Why": The Search for Simplicity

We started Oasis-write because the tools available for markdown writing didn't feel quite right. They were either too much or not enough.

- **Heavy-duty editors like VSCode** are powerful, but they come with features we don't need for writing—terminals, debuggers, and complex configurations. They feel like a workshop when all we need is a desk.
- **Specialized writing apps like Highland 2** offer a beautiful, focused experience but often lack basic file navigation, making it hard to work with a collection of documents.
- **Knowledge-base apps like Obsidian** are incredibly powerful for building a "second brain," but this power comes with complexity. The user interface can feel bloated, and the markdown rendering often feels disconnected—you type the syntax, and the formatting only appears after you move away.
- **All-in-one platforms like Notion** are great for collaboration and databases, but they aren't markdown-native. They do a lot, which means writing is just one of many features, not *the* feature.

We wanted something that sits in the middle: a tool as beautiful and focused as a dedicated writing app, but with the simple, file-based organization that writers need, and a markdown experience that feels truly seamless.

## The Scope: What Oasis-write Is (and Isn't)

Oasis-write is an opinionated application with a clear focus.

**Oasis-write IS:**

- A lightweight, beautiful, and fast markdown editor.
- A tool for writers, bloggers, and developers who work with markdown files.
- A "what you see is what you get" editor with instant markdown formatting.
- An application with a simple, intuitive file-tree for navigation.
- A provider of a "Zen Mode" for completely distraction-free writing.

**Oasis-write IS NOT:**

- A complex, all-in-one "second brain" or personal knowledge management (PKM) system.
- A project management or database tool.
- A collaborative, multi-user platform (at least, not yet).
- An editor with built-in terminals, debuggers, or an extensive plugin marketplace.

## How We're Different

Our differentiation comes from a deliberate focus on the writing experience.

- **Focus over Features:** Unlike Notion and Obsidian, we don't aim to be an everything-tool. Our feature set is intentionally limited to what's essential for a great markdown writing experience. This keeps the app lightweight, fast, and easy to learn.
- **Seamless "Live" Rendering:** While Obsidian renders markdown after you move to a new line, and Notion isn't truly markdown-native, Oasis-write provides instant formatting the moment you type the syntax (e.g., `# `immediately becomes a large heading). This creates a fluid, intuitive experience that feels less like coding and more like writing.
- **Simplicity and Elegance:** We prioritize a clean, minimalist UI that gets out of your way. There are no distracting panes, complex settings, or bloated menus. Just your files and your words.
- **You Own Your Data:** Unlike database-driven apps, Oasis-write works directly with your local markdown files. Your content is always yours, in a portable, universally readable format. There's no lock-in, ever.
- **Truly Native & Cross-Platform:** Oasis-write is not a web app you use in a browser; it's a real desktop application that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. This provides a more integrated and stable experience.
